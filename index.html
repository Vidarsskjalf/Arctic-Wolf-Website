            <h2>About Arctic Wolfs</h2>
                <p>The Arctic wolf <em>(Canis lupus arctos)</em>, also known as the white wolf or polar wolf,<br> is a subspecies of gray wolf native to Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands,<br> from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. It is a medium-sized subspecies,<br> distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter coloration,<br> its narrower braincase, and larger carnassials. Since 1930, there has been a progressive<br> reduction in size in Arctic wolf skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization.</p>

            <h2>Behaviors</h2>
                <p>The Arctic wolf is relatively unafraid of people, and can be coaxed to approach people in some areas.<br> The wolves on Ellesmere Island do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little,<br> and they will approach humans cautiously, curiously and closely. Otto Sverdrup wrote that during the Fram expedition,<br> a pair of wolves shadowed one of his teammates, who kept them at a distance by waving his ski pole. In 1977,<br> a pair of scientists were approached by six wolves on Ellesmere Island, with one animal leaping at one of the<br> scientists and grazing a cheek. A number of incidents involving aggressive wolves have occurred in Alert, Nunavut,<br> where the wolves have lived in close proximity to the local weather station for decades and became habituated to humans.<br> One of these wolves attacked 3 people, was shot, and tested positive for rabies.</p>
