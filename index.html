            <h2>About Arctic Wolfs</h2>
                <p><font size="3">The <strong>Arctic wolf</strong> <em>(Canis lupus arctos)</em>, also known as the white wolf or polar wolf,<br> is a subspecies of gray wolf native to Canada's Queen Elizabeth Islands,<br> from Melville Island to Ellesmere Island. It is a medium-sized subspecies,<br> distinguished from the northwestern wolf by its smaller size, its whiter coloration,<br> its narrower braincase, and larger carnassials. Since 1930, there has been a progressive<br> reduction in size in <strong>Arctic wolf</strong> skulls, which is likely the result of wolf-dog hybridization.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <img src="https://www.josephfiler.com/images/xl/Arctic-Wolf-2322-Edit.jpg" alt="Arctic Wolf" width="400" height="300">
                <p><font size="3"> <strong>Arctic Wolves</strong> are generally smaller than Grey Wolves, measuring around 3 to 6 feet (0.9 to 1.8 metres)<br> long including the tail. Male <strong>Arctic Wolves</strong> are larger than female <strong>Arctic Wolves</strong>. Their shoulder heights<br> vary from 25 to 31 inches (63 to 79 centimetres). <strong>Arctic Wolves</strong> are bulkier than Grey Wolves, often<br> weighing over 100 pounds (45 kilograms). Weights of up to 175 pounds (80 kilograms) have been<br> observed in full-grown males.</p>
        
            <h3>Behaviors</h3>

                <p><font size="3"> The <strong>Arctic wolf</strong> is relatively unafraid of people, and can be coaxed to approach people in some areas.<br> The wolves on Ellesmere Island do not fear humans, which is thought to be due to them seeing humans so little,<br> and they will approach humans cautiously, curiously and closely. Otto Sverdrup wrote that during the Fram expedition,<br> a pair of wolves shadowed one of his teammates, who kept them at a distance by waving his ski pole. In 1977,<br> a pair of scientists were approached by six wolves on Ellesmere Island, with one animal leaping at one of the<br> scientists and grazing a cheek. A number of incidents involving aggressive wolves have occurred in Alert, Nunavut,<br> where the wolves have lived in close proximity to the local weather station for decades and became habituated to humans.<br> One of these wolves attacked 3 people, was shot, and tested positive for rabies.</p>
